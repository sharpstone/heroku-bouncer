# 0.5.2

  @damthieu!

# 0.5.1

Fixed a bug where I forgot to check to see if a deprecated option was
used before emitting a warning (#36).

# 0.5.0

Adds `allow_if` option, and deprecates `herokai_only` (#35). Thanks
@stillinbeta!

# 0.4.3

This release addresses options hash re-use (#34). Thanks @gregburek for
reporting!

# 0.4.2

This release limits the size of the URL stored in the session, which
could result in a cookie overflow condition

# 0.4.1

This release addresses an open redirect security vulernability
addressed in #31. Thanks @raul!

# 0.4.0

This is nearly 1.0 ready, but I would like to see some additional
changes in the following areas:

* Option refactoring. We have a huge number of options now.
* Extensibility. It should be easier to extend/inherit from
  Heroku::Bouncer to tweak its behavior. This was possible under 0.3.x
  but is no longer true in 0.4.0.
* Remove backwards compatibility support (i.e. ENV vars)

To those upgrading, please note that a great deal has changed. Backwards
compatibility with warnings has been maintained in this version, but not
throughly tested. Extensibility has not - you'll need to do some new
tricks if you have extended Heroku::Bouncer in your app.

# 0.4.0.pre\*

Don't store data in the session until after checking email address.

# 0.2.0

  not present.
